Carento is a **modern, OOP-based full-stack multi-vendor car booking platform** built using **FastAPI** (Python) on the backend and **React.js** on the frontend. It follows a **clean, scalable, and modular architecture**, organizing the application with object-oriented design principles for API logic, services, and database models.

## 🔐 Backend Highlights

- OOP-based **FastAPI** backend with service and model layers.
- Asynchronous PostgreSQL integration using **SQLModel**.
- Custom JWT **authentication & authorization** without external libraries.
- **Role-based access control** (Vendor / Customer).
- Versioned **RESTful APIs** following best practices.

## 💡 Frontend Features

- Built with **React.js** and styled using **ShadCN UI**.
- **React Router DOM** with nested layouts powered by `Outlet`.
- **Context API** to manage JWT auth and route protection.
- **Role-aware dashboards** that dynamically change based on user type.

## 📚 Main Modules

- **Vehicles**: Vendor-specific CRUD for car listings.
- **Auth**: Signup, login, profile management, account deletion (Customer & Vendor).
- **Bookings**: Car booking system with vendor & customer-specific histories.
- **Reviews**: Authenticated user review system for vehicles.
- **Wallet**: Add balance and view transaction history.
