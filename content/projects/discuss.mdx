# Discuss

**Discuss** was built with the purpose to create a community of learners so that they can discuss various topics. As this age is blooming, the human brain and the human heart-based discussion really has a great impact.

On this platform, anyone can log in using their GitHub account and then:

- Create topics
- Make posts on topics
- Comment on posts
- Reply to comments

This ensures efficient multi-way communication while breaking personal identity barriers, as the auth is used only via GitHub.
